These two files are modified to allow 9 bit serial from the Mega.
You need to copy them over the files in the arduino IDE distribution, which shows up in the arduino folder in this project.
eg copy these files over the ones in {workspace}/arduino/core/

These files are for Arduino IDE 1.5.7, if you have a different version then you should merge the code rather than copy.
