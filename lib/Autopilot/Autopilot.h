/**
 * Parameters and what they do (sort of)
 * P_Param:  the bigger the number the harder the controller pushes.
 * I_Param:  the SMALLER the number (except for 0, which turns it off,)  the more quickly the controller reacts to load changes, but the greater the risk of oscillations.
 * D_Param: the bigger the number  the more the controller dampens oscillations (to the point where performance can be hindered)

 * These are rules of thumb and aren't exactly what's going on inside the controller, but they should help when deciding which number to change and in which direction.

 * And lastly, if the second you enable the controller the output goes in the wrong direction and pegs at 0 or 100%, you've got the sign of the P_Param wrong.
 * That is, if you've got a 3 in there, make it -3.
