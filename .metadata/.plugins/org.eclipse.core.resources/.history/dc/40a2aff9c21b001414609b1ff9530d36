 Wind
 66  00  XY      Wind alarm as indicated by flags in XY:
 X&8 = 8: Apparent Wind angle low
 X&4 = 4: Apparent Wind angle high
 X&2 = 2: Apparent Wind speed low
 X&1 = 1: Apparent Wind speed high
 Y&8 = 8: True Wind angle low
 Y&4 = 4: True Wind angle high
 Y&2 = 2: True Wind speed low
 Y&1 = 1: True Wind speed high (causes Wind-High-Alarm on ST40 Wind Instrument)
 XY  =00: End of wind alarm (only sent once)

 68  X1 01 00   Alarm acknowledgment keystroke (from ST80 Masterview)
 68  X1 03 00   Alarm acknowledgment keystroke (from ST80 Masterview)
 68  41 15 00   Alarm acknowledgment keystroke (from ST40 Wind Instrument)
